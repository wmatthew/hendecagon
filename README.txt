Hendecagon
An eleven sided electronic puzzle game code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code is split into two parts:

Analysis Scripts (Ruby) Code to analyze structure and feasibility of
games and produce AI strategies for human-vs-computer matches. With
unit tests and a detailed description of each script in README.txt.

Arduino (C++) The code that runs on the microcontroller as the game is
played. Optimized for simplicity and space. The chip has only 2kB SRAM
available for variables/working state, less space than 13 SMS
messages.
